## Lab 4 : Bitmap
Build a bitmap (.bmp) transformer CLI. It will read a bitmap in from disk, run one or more 
color or raster transforms and then write it out to a new file. 

## Requirements
- [x] The CLI should be architected using best modularization practices.  
- [x] The CLI should contain a Bitmap class, and reading in a file should create a new Bitmap instance.  
- [x] The CLI should require at least three arguments: input-file-path output-file-path transfrom-name.  
- [x] The CLI should support a minimum of three transforms, each of which is an instance method in the Bitmap class.  
- [x] The CLI should log useful Error messages if used incorrectly.  
- [x] The CLI should log a success message on completion.
